A GUIDE TO ALL R SCRIPTS AND DATA SHEETS (EXCEL CSV FILES) USED IN THE ANALYSIS OF MICRO-CT DATA IN FORDYCE ET AL.:

"Understanding decay in marine calcifiers: micro-CT analysis of skeletal structures provides insight into the impacts of a changing climate in marine ecosystems"

SUBMITTED FOR CONSIDERATION WITH THE BES JOURNAL 'METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION'

This guide is split by species and method. All packages listed in Table S1 are at the beginning of each script.
Analysis was performed with R 3.6.0.

At the first implementation of each model type (i.e. beta regression, gamma regression), annotations are provided to aid with interpretation
of the model outputs generated by summary().
